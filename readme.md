It'd be nice to not submit our form unless it has a length.

It'd be even nicer to not submit the form if it contains any unnice things.

We could use JavaScript prevent the form's default behavior, validate it
and then submit it.

It might be nice to add some CSS classes to our form if it's invalid.

It might be even nicer to add some Animate.css if it's invalid.

But where does JavaScript go in Rails and what about CSS?
